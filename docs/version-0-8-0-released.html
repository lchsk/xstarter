      <h1>Version 0.8.0 released</h1>
	  <i>2018-08-27</i>
      <p>New version of <strong>xstarter</strong> (v0.8.0) was released today.</p>

<p>Main intention of this release was to enable xstarter to work with external programs. I want to be able to use xstarter via Emacs and I&rsquo;m working on a small package that will handle that. With this release xstarter is able to print a list of programs that it stored in cache (it can be tested by running <code>xstarter -P</code>). External applications can use it load the list of available programs and show it to users. In order to start a program, e.g. Firefox, use command <code>xstarter -e firefox</code>. It can be used on its own to start and detach applications from terminal as well by other software.</p>

<p>In this release I&rsquo;ve also fixed an interesting bug that broke xstarter if it was built without compiler optimisation. I wrote about that bug <a href="https://lchsk.com/when-the-compiler-fixes-your-mistakes.html">on my blog</a>.</p>
