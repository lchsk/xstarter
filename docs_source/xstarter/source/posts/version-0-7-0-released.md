New version of **xstarter** is available (v0.7.0). It adds one useful feature: you can now provide arguments to the application. It works for GUI and terminal programs alike. This allows to start a program like this: `surf gnu.org` (GUI) or e.g. `emacs -nw -Q`.

## How to use it?
If the number of search results is equal to 1, you can provide arguments the selected application should be started with, e.g. `surf gnu.org`. You can provide multiple arguments, e.g. `emacs -nw -Q`. You can select the application you want to provide arguments for by pressing `Tab` key
This feature works both with GUI (press Enter to start) and terminal applications (press C-o to start)
